## Documentation

## Usage

```python
pip install pyPMClient
```

## API Usage

```python
from pyPMClient import PMClient
```

Create PMClient object to use SDK for calling API methods.
```python
# Initialize PMClient using apiKey and apiSecret.
pm = PMClient(api_secret="your_api_secret", api_key="your_api_key", state_key="your_state_key")
# Initialize PMClient using apiKey, apiSecret & access_token if user has already generated.
pm = PMClient(api_secret="your_api_secret", api_key="your_api_key", state_key="your_state_key", access_token="your_access_token")
```

User needs to call the login method and get the login URL.
```python
pm.login()
```


1) User manually executes a login url in the browser and fetches requestToken after validating username, password, OTP and passcode. 
2) After a successful login user will be provided the request_token in the URL.
3) Once the request_token is obtained you can generate access_token by calling generate_session.
```python
pm.generate_session(request_token="your_request_token")
```

After generating the access_token/session any API can be called with same access_token/session.

```python
# Set access Token if you have already. In this case, Don't need to call generateSession method.
pm.set_access_token(access_token)
```

### Place Order

* For cover order in argument user has to add trigger_price.
* For bracket order in argument user has to add stoploss_value & profit_value.
* To place sell CNC order user has to add edis_txn_id and edis_auth_mode.

```python
# Regular Order
order = pm.place_order(txn_type, exchange, segment, product, security_id, quantity, validity, order_type, price, source, off_mkt_flag)
```

```python
# Cover Order
order = pm.place_order(txn_type, exchange, segment, product, security_id, quantity, validity, order_type, price, source, trigger_price)
```

```python
# Bracket Order
order = pm.place_order(txn_type, exchange, segment, product, security_id, quantity, validity, order_type, price, source, stoploss_value, profit_value)
```

```python
# Sell CNC Order
order = pm.place_order(txn_type, exchange, segment, product, security_id, quantity, validity, order_type, price, source, edis_txn_id, edis_auth_mode)
```

### Modify Order
* Here you can modify orders.
* For cover order in argument user has to add leg_no.
* For bracket order in argument user has to add leg_no & algo_order_no.
* To place sell CNC order user has to add edis_txn_id and edis_auth_mode.

```python
# Regular Order
order = pm.modify_order(source, txn_type, exchange, segment, product, security_id, quantity, validity, order_type, price, mkt_type, order_no, serial_no, group_id)
```

```python
# Cover Order
order = pm.modify_order(source, txn_type, exchange, segment, product, security_id, quantity, validity, order_type, price, mkt_type, order_no, serial_no, group_id, leg_no)
```

```python
# Bracket Order
order = pm.modify_order(source, txn_type, exchange, segment, product, security_id, quantity, validity, order_type, price, mkt_type, order_no, serial_no, group_id, leg_no, algo_order_no)
```

```python
